## 💎 Professional Hi-Fi Experience
HOA Music Player Pro is a Material-You designed player featuring a **State-of-the-Art Audio Engine**. Unlike standard players, it uses **32-bit Floating Point Modeling** to simulate high-end analog hardware and psychoacoustic effects for a truly "Real" music experience.

## 🚀 Advanced Audio Engine (New!)
- **Vacuum Tube Saturator**: Adds even-order harmonics to emulate the warm, organic sound of vintage tube amplifiers.
- **Phantom Bass & Hard Punch**: Generates 2nd harmonics for depth while a transient shaper ensures a "hard" and impactful bass thump.
- **Vocal L/R Support**: Dedicated side-channel processing to make backing vocals and vocal atmosphere sound wide and immersive.
- **Deep Detail Engine**: Upward compression on the side channels to bring out subtle instrument effects and reverb tails (the "low bits").
- **Binaural Crossfeed**: Simulates a live speaker environment by gently blending channels, reducing headphone fatigue.
- **Diamond Clarity**: Proprietary "Harmonic Exciter" that adds air and sparkle to the treble without harshness.
- **Sub-Bass Rumble Filter**: A 20Hz high-pass filter that cleans up subsonic mud, keeping your bass tight and punchy.
- **High-Res Output**: Forces 32-bit Float PCM output for maximum dynamic range.

## 🎚️ Signature Audio Presets
One-tap professional tunings to instantly transform your sound:
- **The HOA Signature**: Balanced, warm, and highly detailed (Golden Sound).
- **Bass Head**: Focused on deep sub-bass and massive impact.
- **Vocal Air**: Highlights every breath and detail in acoustic/pop tracks.
- **Live Stadium**: Creates an immersive, wide, and ambient 3D soundstage.
- **Vinyl Warmth**: Rich analog texture with classic rolled-off highs.

## 🎨 Modern Design
- **Material You**: Fully adapts to your system colors (Android 12+).
- **Professional UI**: Sleek "Equalizer Play" branding and polished, animated interfaces.
- **Extended Colors**: Choose from a wide range of accent colors and themes.
- **Themes**: Clearly White, Kinda Dark, and Just Black.

**Q: Does Phantom Bass work on all speakers?**
A: Yes! It is specifically designed to help small speakers and cheap earbuds reproduce the *feeling* of deep bass by using psychoacoustic harmonic generation.
